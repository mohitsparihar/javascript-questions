/*
Given two promises promise1 and promise2, return a new promise. promise1 and promise2 will
both resolve with a number. The returned promise should resolve with the sum of the two numbers.
 

Example:

Input: 
promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 20)), 
promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(5), 60))
Output: 7
Explanation: The two input promises resolve with the values of 2 and 5 respectively. The returned 
promise should resolve with a value of 2 + 5 = 7. The time the returned promise resolves is not 
judged for this problem.

    return Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then(values => values[0] + values[1])
};
